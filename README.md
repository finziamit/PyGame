# 🎮 PyGame Repository 🎮

Welcome to my PyGame learning and practice repository! Here, I've created exciting games and projects to enhance my PyGame skills. Let's have some fun! 😄

## How to Use 🚀
1. Make sure you have Pygame installed on your computer. If not, install it using `pip install pygame`.
2. Clone this repository using `git clone` and navigate to the main directory `PyGame`.
3. Copy the `.py` file from the `xth game` folder to the main directory `PyGame`.
4. Run the `.py` file of the chosen game (for example: `python Juggle.py`).
5. Enjoy the game and explore the magic of PyGame! 🎉

## 🎮 First Game - Classic Pygame Fun 🎮
The first game is inspired by a fantastic YouTube tutorial for Pygame. You can find the tutorial at this link: [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk).
Please note that while the game has some similarities, I've added my own creative twists! 🎨

## 🎮 Second Game - Juggle Challenge 🤹‍♂️
The second game is an exciting juggle challenge where you'll need to control each hand to prevent the balls from falling. It's a custom creation, designed to practice and apply the skills I gained from the first game! 💪
