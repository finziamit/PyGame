# PyGame
This repo was created for PyGame learning and practicing
The first game is based on a YT tutorial for pygame you can find it in the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk
Notice that the game is not the exact same thing as I decided to make my own modifications to it.
The second game is 100% original
