## First game
The first game is based on a YT tutorial for pygame you can find it in the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk
Notice that the game is not the exact same and some ideas of my own were added.

## Second game
The second game is a juggle game where you can control each hand and can't let a ball fall.
This game was not based on any video or guide and implemented in order to practice and test what I learnd from the first game.
